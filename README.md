# GCD_Calculator_Verilog
This repository includes a verilog code to implement a hardware which finds the GDC of two positive integers.
In this code I have used the Euclidean Algorithm to find the GCD.
To implemetn the design I have used two parallel in parallel registers to store the value of input integers, three multiplexers, one comperator to compare the value of the inputs.
